          <p>
            TwoPaws is committed to providing exceptional service in a timely
            manner. Unfortunately, when a customer cancels without giving enough
            notice, it prevents another customer from being served. No shows and
            late cancellation have an impact on service quality while punishing
            customers who may show up earlier. For these reasons. TwoPaws has
            implemented a cancellation policy that will be strictly observed.
          </p>

            confirmation of your registration.

          <p>
            Please be advised that the official business days in the TwoPaws are
            from Sunday to Thursday. Fridays, Saturdays, holidays, and public
            holidays are holidays for all employees of TwoPaws and shipping
            companies. TwoPaws mainly delivers your orders through a third party
            to ensure the timely shipping of your order. The method of delivery
            at TwoPaws is to deliver within two to four days as a maximum,
            depending on your geographical area, giving you the option to choose
            the right time for you to deliver at any time during the day, week
            or even during the month.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the case of urgent orders, please contact our customer service
            and we will do our best to help you. We will ask for your signature
            on a copy of the invoice to confirm receipt of the goods. We will
            deliver the order to the registered address, and we consider the
            signature of anyone at the address as a receipt of the order. If
            there is no one at the registered address to receive your order, we
            will ask you to contact our customer service to agree another
            delivery time. The company is not able to attempt delivery more than
            twice. The company is not responsible for any order exceeding 7 days
            of the first delivery attempt.
          </p>
          <p>
            In-stock Orders are fulfilled within 5-7 business days. Custom-made
            Orders are fulfilled according to the individual production time
            which is stated on the product description page. Delivery cost is
            calculated at check-out depending on the product and the delivery
            address or quoted after order for special orders and included on
            your order's final balance.
          </p>
          <p>
            An estimated delivery time will be provided to you once your order
            is placed. Delivery times are estimates and commence from the date
            of shipping, rather than the date of order. Unless there are
            exceptional circumstances, we make every effort to fulfill your
            order within 5 business days of the date of your order. The date of
            delivery may vary due to carrier shipping practices, delivery
            location, method of delivery, and the items ordered. Products may
            also be delivered in separate shipments.
